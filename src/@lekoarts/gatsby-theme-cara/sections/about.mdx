## About

I am a front end software engineer with a background in sales. I take pride in delivering an engaging user experience with the latest JavaScript tools. I've always drawn energy from the rapid pace of web technology innovation and its abundance of learning opportunities. And while the pace of technology continues to accelerate, attention spans continue to suffer, which is why I am most passionate about building fast and captivating UI's.   

I graduated from Colgate University with a degree in philosophy in 2013, and I’ve been seriously contemplating the meaning of life ever since. After a period of coast-to-coast exploring, I’m currently settled in Austin, Texas with my beautiful wife, Kelly and my ugly bulldog, Hugo.
